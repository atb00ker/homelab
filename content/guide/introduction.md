## About Me

Hi,

I go around on the internet as [@atb00ker](https://github.com/atb00ker).
I am a software engineer by profession and here are a bunch of facts about me to help you understand if this guide is for you.

#### Why do I homelab?

I enjoy being the master of my own digital universe.
I'm **terrified of losing access** to things I love, and the idea of **endless subscription services** and their constant march towards **enshitification** makes me break out in hives. I value the ownership of my own data & services.

Hence, obviously, instead of spending time, effort and a fortune on therapy to figure out my control issues, I decided to channel my inner tech enthusiast and build my own server at home.

#### Why do I write this guide?

Homelabbing has been a passion of mine for many years, and I've gathered valuable insights that I want to share. Writing this guide is a project I consider part of **my legacy**. (I intend to begin writing this guide in earnest in the next couple of years.)

I only hope this guide will be a **meaningful contribution that I leave behind**. I do not intend to monetize this guide in anyway. I will not sell out to some VPN provider lying through their teeth about what their honeypot does. All product recommendations and endorsments are purely my own personal opinions formed with usage of the products over time.
